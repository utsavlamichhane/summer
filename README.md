Keras neural network: summer_143_samples 

This model predicts the efficiency using keras nn. 


This machine learning pipeline is designed to classify rumen and fecal data using a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras. The data is preprocessed with Pandas and Scikit-learn for training and evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset, 'entire_data.xlsx,' your dataset should consist of features and a target column. The first column is considered the target variable, and the rest are feature variables.

Features
- Data preprocessing with Pandas
- Label encoding for categorical data with Scikit-learn's LabelEncoder
- Data splitting into training and testing sets
- Neural network architecture with TensorFlow Keras, including:
  - Input layer with 32 neurons
  - Hidden layer with 16 neurons
  - Output layer with neurons corresponding to the number of classes
- Compilation with Adam optimizer and accuracy metrics
- Model training and evaluation
